//  LoadingSpinner.swift
//  LLM-Window
//
//  Purpose: Reusable animated loading indicator component for displaying progress during async operations.
//  This view provides a consistent loading spinner that can be used throughout the application
//  when performing API calls, loading data, or other time-consuming operations. It offers
//  customizable appearance options including size, color, and animation style to match
//  different contexts and design requirements within the chat interface.
//
//  Usage: Used in ChatView during message sending/receiving, in SettingsView during
//  API validation, and anywhere else async operations need visual feedback. Can be
//  overlaid on content or displayed inline as needed.
